Remember how free clouds are. They just lay around in the sky all day long. You can create the world you want to see and be a part of. You have that power. Nature is so fantastic, enjoy it. Let it make you happy. Happy painting, God bless. It's life. It's interesting. It's fun. This is probably the greatest thing that's ever happened in my life.

You can get away with a lot. It just happens - whether or not you worried about it or tried to plan it. You can do anything here. So don't worry about it. Let's do that again.

We don't want to set these clouds on fire. We don't have anything but happy trees here. Let your heart take you to wherever you want to be. We artists are a different breed of people. We're a happy bunch. Water's like me. It's laaazyÂ ... Boy, it always looks for the easiest way to do things A fan brush is a fantastic piece of equipment. Use it. Make friends with it.

Just let go - and fall like a little waterfall. There we go. God gave you this gift of imagination. Use it. This is a happy place, little squirrels live here and play. Paint anything you want on the canvas. Create your own world.

Only eight colors that you need. Everything's not great in life, but we can still find beauty in it. For the lack of a better word I call them hangy downs. I like to beat the brush. That's what painting is all about. It should make you feel good when you paint.

If you do too much it's going to lose its effectiveness. Let's make some happy little clouds in our world. The man who does the best job is the one who is happy at his job. You don't have to spend all your time thinking about what you're doing, you just let it happen. There is immense joy in just watching - watching all the little creatures in nature. We don't really know where this goes - and I'm not sure we really care.

At home you have unlimited time. Use what you see, don't plan it. The shadows are just like the highlights, but we're going in the opposite direction. This is probably the greatest thing to happen in my life - to be able to share this with you. If you didn't have baby clouds, you wouldn't have big clouds. Didn't you know you had that much power? You can move mountains. You can do anything.
